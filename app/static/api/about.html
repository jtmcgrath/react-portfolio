      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Hello! I'm Joe McGrath, and I've been developing websites for over eight years.</p>
      <p>In that time I've worked on everything you'd expect a small web & print design agency to cover, and have developed a love for clean, innovative, flexible websites. WordPress has been my go-to technology in recent years, though I also love hand-coding things to get every detail just right. I've worked hard to earn an instinctive knowledge of the various technologies I work with, which allows me to quickly solve problems and see solutions to anything that gets thrown at me.</p>
      <p>I landed my first job in the industry while still studying - three years before graduation in fact - and have kept the same job ever since. Over that time, both the company itself and my role within it have grown and changed focus, and it has been great to play a part in guiding that development. Take a look at my résumé to find out more about what I do.</p>
      <p>A large part of my professional development is entangled with the history of the two online games my fiancée and I made together - but that's a <i>very</i> long story, and will have to wait to be told another time. For now, you'll have to make do with the screenshots in the two respective project pages, and ask me about them if you want to know more!</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Not personal enough? Okay, fine.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Manchester, UK - United not City, thank you very much - and I currently live in Helsinki, Finland. Our family includes a husky and four cats (all adopted, but don't tell <em>them</em> that), and nobody here can ever decide who is in charge. I'm pretty sure it's not me.</p>
      <p>When I'm not making websites or being bossed around by the various creatures who like to think of me as their personal minion, you can find me watching films or football, playing games, or reading <s>far too many</s> books. I also spend a lot of time co-writing fiction with my fiancée, or going on long walks along the coast and through the forests nearby.</p>

    </header>
    <section>
      <p>This site was hand-built by me. The original version used HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery, but I've rebuilt it using React. The site is hosted using GitHub pages - <a href="https://github.com/jtmcgrath/jtmcgrath.github.io" target="_blank">site repo here</a> - and the source code is also available in <a href="https://github.com/jtmcgrath/react-portfolio" target="_blank">a separate repo</a>.</p>
      <p>Much credit goes to <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/2016/05/13/sghpa-the-single-page-app-hack-for-github-pages/" target="_blank">Daniel Buchner</a> for the neat trick which allows for single-page applications to be hosted within GitHub pages!</p>
      <p><em>No kittens were harmed during the production of this website. Cats will <strong>not</strong> starve if they're not fed every thirty minutes, despite what they might tell you. Do not listen to their lies.</em></p>

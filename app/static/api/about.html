    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Hello! I'm Joe McGrath, and I've been building software for the web for over eight years.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Manchester, UK - United not City, thank you very much - and I currently live in Edinburgh, Scotland. Our family includes a husky and two cats (all adopted, but don't tell <em>them</em> that), and nobody here can ever decide who is in charge. I'm pretty sure it's not me.</p>
      <p>When I'm not making websites or being bossed around by the various creatures who like to think of me as their personal minion, you can find me watching films or football, playing games, or reading <s>far too many</s> books. I also spend a lot of time co-writing fiction with my fianc√©e, or going on long walks through the hidden paths of Edinburgh.</p>

    <section>
      <p>This site was hand-built by me. The original version used HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery, but I've rebuilt it using React. The site is hosted using GitHub pages - <a href="https://github.com/jtmcgrath/jtmcgrath.github.io" target="_blank">site repo here</a> - and the source code is also available in <a href="https://github.com/jtmcgrath/react-portfolio" target="_blank">a separate repo</a>. Please don't look at it - it's extremely out of date, and in dire need of a rewrite!</p>
      <p>Much credit goes to <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/2016/05/13/sghpa-the-single-page-app-hack-for-github-pages/" target="_blank">Daniel Buchner</a> for the neat trick which allows for single-page applications to be hosted within GitHub pages!</p>
      <p><em>No kittens were harmed during the production of this website. Cats will <strong>not</strong> starve if they're not fed every thirty minutes, despite what they might tell you. Do not listen to their lies.</em></p>
